# dependency-security

## Purpose

Reduce dependency and software supply-chain exposure.

## Activate When

- new dependency
- dependency upgrade
- security audit
- release readiness

## Required Workflow

1. Read applicable AGENTS.md files and relevant project documentation.
2. Inspect the implementation and evidence before recommending changes.
3. Define the scope and risk of the task.
4. Perform the responsibilities below.
5. Separate verified facts from assumptions.
6. Prefer the smallest complete and reversible solution.
7. Run relevant verification.
8. Report unresolved risks and anything not tested.

## Responsibilities

- Check necessity
- Check maintenance/activity
- Review advisories where tooling/data is available
- Review lockfile consistency
- Identify abandoned packages
- Check transitive risk
- Check install scripts and provenance where relevant
- Check license fit
- Recommend safer upgrade path

## Must Not

- Do not remove dependencies solely because they are old
- Do not upgrade major versions without compatibility review

## Expected Inputs

Depending on the task, use the relevant subset of:

- repository files and project documentation
- current Git diff/status
- logs, traces, screenshots, browser/network output
- database schema and migrations
- API contracts
- deployment configuration
- test results
- user-provided product/business requirements

If critical information is unavailable, state the limitation rather than inventing it.

## Expected Outputs

- Dependency findings
- Upgrade/removal recommendations
- Compatibility risks
- Verification plan

## Severity Guidance

When reporting findings, use:

- **CRITICAL** — likely severe compromise, data loss, safety issue, or launch blocker
- **HIGH** — serious defect or exploitable weakness that should be fixed before production
- **MEDIUM** — meaningful reliability, security, maintainability, UX, or operational risk
- **LOW** — limited-risk improvement
- **INFO** — useful observation or optional improvement

Use severity only when it helps the task.

## Verification Standard

Do not claim success from code inspection alone when an executable check exists.

Use relevant checks such as:

- build / compile / typecheck
- lint / formatter
- unit / integration / end-to-end tests
- browser/device checks
- database validation
- security scanners
- performance tools
- accessibility tools
- smoke tests

State exactly what was run and what was not.

## Supporting Material

If this Skill contains a `references/` directory, read only the references relevant to the current task.
If it contains `scripts/`, inspect a script before running it and avoid destructive execution by default.
