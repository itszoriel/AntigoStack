# api-review

## Purpose

Produce predictable, secure, evolvable APIs.

## Activate When

- new endpoint
- API redesign
- public API
- webhook
- mobile backend
- API audit

## Required Workflow

1. Read applicable AGENTS.md files and relevant project documentation.
2. Inspect the implementation and evidence before recommending changes.
3. Define the scope and risk of the task.
4. Perform the responsibilities below.
5. Separate verified facts from assumptions.
6. Prefer the smallest complete and reversible solution.
7. Run relevant verification.
8. Report unresolved risks and anything not tested.

## Responsibilities

- Review resource/action model
- Review request/response schemas
- Validate server-side
- Review authn/authz
- Check object/function-level authorization
- Review status/error format
- Review pagination/filter/sort
- Review versioning/backward compatibility
- Review idempotency for mutations
- Review rate limits
- Review caching
- Review webhook signatures/replay protection

## Must Not

- Do not expose internal stack traces
- Do not use client-side validation as authority
- Do not break existing consumers silently

## Expected Inputs

Depending on the task, use the relevant subset of:

- repository files and project documentation
- current Git diff/status
- logs, traces, screenshots, browser/network output
- database schema and migrations
- API contracts
- deployment configuration
- test results
- user-provided product/business requirements

If critical information is unavailable, state the limitation rather than inventing it.

## Expected Outputs

- API findings
- Contract recommendations
- Security issues
- Compatibility plan
- Test cases

## Severity Guidance

When reporting findings, use:

- **CRITICAL** — likely severe compromise, data loss, safety issue, or launch blocker
- **HIGH** — serious defect or exploitable weakness that should be fixed before production
- **MEDIUM** — meaningful reliability, security, maintainability, UX, or operational risk
- **LOW** — limited-risk improvement
- **INFO** — useful observation or optional improvement

Use severity only when it helps the task.

## Verification Standard

Do not claim success from code inspection alone when an executable check exists.

Use relevant checks such as:

- build / compile / typecheck
- lint / formatter
- unit / integration / end-to-end tests
- browser/device checks
- database validation
- security scanners
- performance tools
- accessibility tools
- smoke tests

State exactly what was run and what was not.

## Supporting Material

If this Skill contains a `references/` directory, read only the references relevant to the current task.
If it contains `scripts/`, inspect a script before running it and avoid destructive execution by default.

## V5 Professional Standard

Use this Skill as a professional decision framework, not a checklist. Frame the real outcome, inspect evidence, test competing explanations, choose a proportional solution, and verify the result at the strongest practical level. Respect repository-pinned versions and distinguish fact, inference, assumption, recommendation, unknown, and manual verification when material.

For deeper reasoning, read `references/EXPERT_PLAYBOOK.md` and only the relevant shared V5 field guide. Do not bulk-load unrelated references.
